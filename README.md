# CarRentalProjectCRD
This project contains 4 classes 
Vehicle which contains an Enum VehicleType for the 3 possible type of cars a customer can rent..The 3 types of cars all have different prices.
CarReservation class is a POJO with the Reservation attributes
CarReservationController contains the utility functions that perform the addReservation, deleteReservation, calculateReservationPrice as well as validatePhoneNumber. 
I included the carRentalClient class which contains some of the core methods
Lastly I included the CarReservationTest class which I did using JUnit. I included ample comments in my code as well
